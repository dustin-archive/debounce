Debounce - 1.0.0
==========

A jQuery plugin that debounces events.



## Quick Start

You would use this in place of jQuery's `on()`.

Arguments in order are: event, callback, delay. All arguments are required and there are no defaults set.

```js
$(window).debounce('scroll', customFunction, 125);
```
